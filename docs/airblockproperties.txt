-air
--o2
--co2

--n2o
--plasma //Ideally none of this will actually be in the air initially. Fire hazards and all that.
--temperature //The current temp, in kelvin. Presure is derived from the number of moles of the above and this.
-physical //Physical properties.
--name //The name when you mouse over the block.
--solid //Solid blocks cannot be passed by people. Different than allowing air through! (This is handled by the proto's tradeAir
--icon //This is the icon file the block uses. I.E. "tiles.png"
--iconState //This is the sprite in the spritesheet it is using atm.
--gasOverlay //These are things like plasma/N2O haze and fire. Also smoke and such.
--description //What you see when you "look" at it. "I.E. This wall has a drawing of SS13. It is on fire."

--holy //This is a "blessed" block by the priest. Cultists are burned by it.
--lubed //This is the "lube level" of the block. 1 makes you slip. 2 makes you slide.(Spess lube effect)
--mime //This is an impassible block to players due to the mime. This property is removed by a callback later on. Thrown objects and such ignore it.

voidBlock //Space! Pretty much no properties. Just eats air by handling the tradeAir function, but not giving air to the blocks that touch it. Ever.
